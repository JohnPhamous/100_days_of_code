### R1D1
I was very busy with commencement today and getting prepared to leave for China that I wasn't able to program much. I put in a couple of lines of code when I got home to help the gallery on my website for China enlarge the image when the mouse hovers over it.

### R1D2
Today I ran around from Riverside back to home and back to Riverside. A given of 3 total hours of driving. Along with 2 doctor's appointments which took up the majority of my day. Luckily while waiting in the offices of the doctor's appointments, I was able to sit down and code a bit on the website for China. I leave in 1 day for my flight to China to do research through UCR. I'm super pumped but not quite sure how much I can keep up with the 100 days of coding. I'm going to try my best to sit down at the end of the day and at least get one hour in. Woot let's do this.
